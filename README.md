# Country Based Payments for Woocommerce


Tested up to Woocommerce 4.5.2

Integrated with `Woocommerce Subscriptions`.

With this plugin you can upgrade currencies automatically using 3 different currency converters for more security and stability (if the  converter doesnt work the plugin will try with the next one).

You can change the product price, the currency symbol and the payment gateway based on the geoIP country or the billing country and the product type. 

## How to Install it


1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/country-based-payments/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly. 

1. Activate through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

1. Go to `Woocommerce` > `Settings` > `Payments by Location` to set your options.
